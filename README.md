### What is Next.js?
Next is a React frontend development web framework created by Vercel (formerly Zeit) that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and static site generation.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Unlike a traditional React app where the entire application is loaded and rendered on the client, Next.js allows the first page load to be rendered by the server, which is great for SEO & performance.

### Other Next.js Benefits
* Easy page routing
* API Routes
* Out of the box TypeScript & Sass
* Static site generation (next export)
* Easy deployment
